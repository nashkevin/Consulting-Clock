This is just a test I made to get the logic figured out. Console output
simulates the physical display (strobe warning). Numpad keys simulate the
physical buttons.

# How to Use

Numpad 1 through 5

* Short press (paused) → start timer and pause other timers
* Short press (running) → pause timer
* Long press → reset timer

Numpad 0

* Long press → reset all timers
